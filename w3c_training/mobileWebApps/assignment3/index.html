        <header><h1>Extend the MyDiary Application</h1></header>
        <p>
            A few things that would greatly enhance the Diary Application that you created in Assignment 2
            are:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>A simple form to actually create new entries through a form!</li>
            <li>The ability to manage (and delete) existing entries.</li>
            <li>The ability to log where they user was were when they wrote a given entry.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Modify your Assignment 2 diary application so that the user can actually manage their own entries.
            When the user saves an entry, add the location information for each entry and store the entry data
            into localStorage. Be sure to take into account the fact that the user may choose not to provide
            Geolocation information and that the APIs may not be available.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>OPTIONAL</b>: If you are feeling like challenging yourself, add swipe event support as a means to delete an entry (or find some other interesting use for it). Again, be sure to take a progressive enhancement approach here. You might also like to add support for taking a photo if the browser supports it (covered in Week 5) or make use of any of the bleeding edge APIs covered in Week 5.

            <h2>Assignment 3: My Assignment 3 Data</h2>
        </header>

        <p>
            I viewed the web app with the following devices:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Samsung Galaxy S4 (Android 4.2)</li>
            <li>Kindle Fire HD</li>
            <li>Apple iPad Air (iOS 7)</li>
            <li>Windows 7 PC 24inch monitor with the current Chrome and Firefox versions</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            You can call the MyDiary web application via two URLs:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="./diary/index.html">diary/index.html</a><br/>(MyDiary)</li>
            <li><a href="./diary/index.html?clear">diary/index.html?clear</a><br/>(MyDiary with optional all entries removal - if entries are available)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I have implemented the following features:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add a new entry</li>
            <li>Modify an existing entry</li>
            <li>Delete an entry</li>
            <li>Optional adding of location info to an entry</li>
            <li>View the location data on a Google map</li>
            <li>Optional adding an image/photo an entry</li>
            <li>View the image in an extra window</li>
            <li>Show hints via a title attribute for almost all actions<br/>
                (useful for mouse based devices)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            By default you will see only the head lines of the entries. By clicking on each headline
            you can expand/collapse the related entry. As an alternative you can use the &quot;Expand Entries&quot;
            button to expand/collapse all entries at once.<br/>
            All data are stored in one localStorage item as a stringified JSON array of entry objects
            (self defined JavaScript object DiaryEntry).
        </p>

        <p>
            Create/modify an entry<br/>
            You will see the following icons:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><img alt="Save" src="diary/images/OK.png"/> Save entry.</li>
            <li><img alt="Cancel" src="diary/images/Abort.png"/> Cancel creation or modifying of an entry.</li>
            <li><img alt="Show geo location" src="diary/images/Compass.png"/> Add geo location data of current location.</li>
            <li><img alt="Capture snapshot" src="diary/images/View.png"/> Use camera for a snapshot.<br/>
                Opens a new tab where you can use the camera for a snapshot. After clicking on close or closing the
                tab manually you are back and tge photo will be saved with the entry.</li>
            <li><img alt="Upload image" src="diary/images/Upload.png"/> Upload an image.<br/>
                Opens a new tab where you can upload an image or use the camera for a snapshot. After clicking
                on close or closing the tab manually you are back and tge photo will be saved with the entry.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Show an entry<br/>
            You will see the following icons:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><img alt="Modify" src="diary/images/Modify.png"/> Modify the entry.</li>
            <li><img alt="Delete" src="diary/images/Abort.png"/> Delete the entry.</li>
            <li><img alt="Show geo location" src="diary/images/Compass.png"/> View the geo location data on a Google map.</li>
            <li><img alt="Show image" src="diary/images/View.png"/> View the stored image.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The snapshot functionality (<a href="./diary/camera.html">./diary/camera.html</a>) and the
            upload feature (<a href="./diary/imageLoader.html">./diary/imageLoader.html</a>) can be used
            as part of the MyDiary web application or standalone.<br/>
            A localStorage item ist used for the communication between the MyDiary web application and
            the above extra pages.
