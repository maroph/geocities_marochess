    <p>
        I viewed the web app with the following devices:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Samsung Galaxy S4</li>
        <li>Kindle Fire HD</li>
        <li>Apple iPad air</li>
        <li>Windows 7 PC 24inch monitor</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        In principle I like this up. But I would prefer a much more compacted page layout for the use with
        mobile devices. Running <a href="http://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">Google PageSpeed Insights</a>
        shows some potential problems with this web app which fit in with my own observations.
    </p>

    <h3>Detected problems</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>A fixed page width of 960px is used.</b><br/>
            The web app seems in no way to be adapted for the usage on a mobile device.<br/>
            On a smaller device you will see a scaled down version of the page. Which is no
            more readable. Before you can use the page you have to zoom in but than you cna read
            the text but don't see the necessary context anymore. You can use the app on a phone
            of the size like a Samsung Galaxy S4 only in landscape mode.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>The footer line sticks to the bottom of the visible area of your browser window.</b><br/>
            Entering a new entry in the diary will open a soft keyboard on a mobile phone. This
            makes the visible area of the input form field already very small. Showing the footer
            line also makes it even worse.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>More than 950 lines of CSS code.</b><br/>
            The web app uses 3 CSS files - an own one and 2 copied - with more than 950 lines
            of CSS code in total. This will slow down the page loading. Especially as a lot of the
            CSS code isn't used in the app.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>The <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">W3C CSS Validation Service</a> shows 21 errors.</b><br/>
            It is always good style to check the HTML and CSS code with a validator before publishing.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Google Fonts included</b><br/>
            Same as above is true for using an external font: looks nice but slows dwon the loading
            of the page.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Usage of local storage.</b><br/>
            The data are stored in the browser's local storage under the name data. I see two
            problems with this approach: 1st problem: data is a very generic name, i.e. any other web app
            can use the same name. Better would be a unique name like myDiaryData, or even better
            com.robineko.myDiaryData. 2nd problem: the usage of the browser's local storage doesn't
            allow to share the data over several devices. If this is what was intended with the app,
            this is, of course, okay.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Make the web app offline aware.</b><br/>
            As the web app uses local storage it should also use a .appcache manifest file. This will allow
            the offline usage of the app.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Usage of an old external jQuery version</b><br>
            The app uses an old Google hosted jQuery version 1.5.1. If Google deletes this old
            version, the app won't work anymore. Personally I prefer a local copy of jQuery to
            prevent such problems.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Mixing HTML with JavaScript code</b><br/>
            Only a personal preference: I would pack all the JavaScript code in a file (e.g. in the
            available diary.js file) and add the onclick event functions dynamically (addListener)
            to the desired HTML elements. This gives a clean separation between static HTML code and
            the dynamic JavaScript code.
        </li>
